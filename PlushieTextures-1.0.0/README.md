## Oops! All Jimbos

This is just a tiny Balatro mod that replaces every basegame joker texture with Jimbo

Some jokers look weird- namely the ones that are differently sized are off center and Invisible Joker has a shader, but I'm not changing that. Adds to the charm, you see?

Malverk is now compatible and actually required!
